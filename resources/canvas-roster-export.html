Navigate to the People page, then open the console (also known as Developer Tools) of your browser. (Often found by hitting F12.) Then paste the script below:
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var url = '/api/v1/courses/' + (typeof ENV.COURSE !== 'undefined' ? ENV.COURSE.id : ENV.course.id) + '/users';
$.getJSON(url, 'per_page=100&include[]=email', function(d) {
  console.log(d.map(function(e) {
    return [ 'sortable_name', 'email' ].map(function(f) {
      return e[f];
    }).join('\t');
  }).join('\n'));
});
{% endhighlight %}

Instead of the two fields (sortable name, email) you may want other fields. Most likely might be [ 'name', 'sortable_name', 'login_id', 'email' ] or for a full list, from the <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/users.html">API documentation</a> for user objects:
{% highlight javascript linenos %}
{
  "id": 2, // The ID of the user.
  "name": "Sheldon Cooper", // The name of the user.
  "sortable_name": "Cooper, Sheldon", // The name of the user that is should be used for sorting groups of users, such as in the gradebook.
  "short_name": "Shelly",   // A short name the user has selected, for use in conversations or other less formal places through the site.
  "sis_user_id": "SHEL93921",   // The SIS ID associated with the user.  This field is only included if the user came from a SIS import and has permissions to view SIS information.
  "sis_import_id": 18,   // The id of the SIS import.  This field is only included if the user came from a SIS import and has permissions to manage SIS information.
  "integration_id": "ABC59802",   // The integration_id associated with the user.  This field is only included if the user came from a SIS import and has permissions to view SIS information.

  "avatar_url": "https://en.gravatar.com/avatar/d8cb8c8cd40ddf0cd05241443a591868?s=80&r=g", // If avatars are enabled, this field will be included and contain a url to retrieve the user's avatar.

  "enrollments": null,  // Optional: This field can be requested with certain API calls, and will return a list of the users active enrollments. See the List enrollments API for more details about the format of these records.
  "email": "sheldon@caltech.example.com",  // Optional: This field can be requested with certain API calls, and will return the users primary email address.
  "locale": "tlh",  // Optional: This field can be requested with certain API calls, and will return the users locale in RFC 5646 format.
