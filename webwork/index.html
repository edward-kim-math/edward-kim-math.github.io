<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
There is also a <a href="admin.html">WeBWorK errors (for administrators)</a> page.

<h2>I can access my course, but it's not showing up in course list</h2>
I am able to log in, but my course is not shown on the <a href="https://webworkcanvas.uwlax.edu/webwork2/">course list</a>.
<ul>
<li>Everything will actually run just fine, and students are not looking at the left navigation bar or the course list page anyway,
since they will access direct links from your Canvas. Nevertheless, if you want it to show, ask the administrator to "unhide" your course.</li>
<li>Courses can be hidden or shown. (It is typical to hide a course when it hasn't been used for a while, so that the list of courses is not cluttered.
Hiding a course keeps all the content there. In fact, it is still possible for you and for your students to log in.)</li>
</ul>
