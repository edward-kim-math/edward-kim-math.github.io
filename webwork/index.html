<h2>I can access my course, but it's not showing up in course list</h2>
I am able to log in, but my course is not shown on the <a href="https://webworkcanvas.uwlax.edu/webwork2/">course list</a>.
<ul>
<li>Everything will actually run just fine, and students are not looking at the left navigation bar or the course list page anyway,
since they will access direct links from your Canvas. Nevertheless, if you want it to show, ask the administrator to "unhide" your course.</li>
<li>Courses can be hidden or shown. (It is typical to hide a course when it hasn't been used for a while, so that the list of courses is not cluttered.
Hiding a course keeps all the content there. In fact, it is still possible for you and for your students to log in.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>While most problems in the Library Browser are showing, some statistics problems are not</h2>
It is probably related to the R server. To confirm this, from the Library Browser, click the "eye" icon to preview the problem (or, you might already be in a single problem in a homework set). If the error you see looks like this:
{% highlight %}

with the key thing being the second line saying <u>RserveClient.pl</u> and the third line saying <u>Rserve.pm</u> then ask the administrator to start/restart the Rserve server.
