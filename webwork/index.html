<h2>All problems are not showing, even in the Library Browser</h2>
If the view in the Library Browser has the error
{% highlight plaintext %}
/webwork2/html2xml: Unexpected token '<', "
Webwor"... is not valid JSON
{% endhighlight %}
on each problem, as shown in the screenshot below (click to see it larger)<br>
<a href="json-library-browser.png"><img src="json-library-browser.png" width="500"></a><br>
and the view of a specific problem shows the following error
{% highlight plaintext %}
WeBWorK error
An error occured while processing your request.
For help, please send mail to this site's webmaster (webmaster@localhost), including all of the following information as well as what what you were doing when the error occured.

The following information can help locate the source of the problem.

{% endhighlight %}
as shown in the screenshot below (click to see it larger)<br>
<a href="json-individual-problem.png"><img src="json-individual-problem.png" width="500"></a><br>
then there is probably a JSON error, and the server needs to be restarted by the administrator. (That is, the machine should be restarted, not just the Apache service.)

<h2>Many/most/all of my problems from a past semester are not showing</h2>
<p>If you see an error which looks like this
{% highlight plaintext %}
        Problem5
1. ERROR caught by Translator while processing problem file:Library/CollegeOfIdaho/setAlgebra_01_04_SolveLinearEq/14IntAlg_09_SolveLinear.pg

{% endhighlight %}
which is (for example) shown in the screenshot below (click to see it larger)<br>
<a href="missing-pg-file.png"><img src="missing-pg-file.png" width="500"></a><br>
and note the text that says <u>This problem file was empty!</u>, then the pg file is missing. (There is actually VERY little data that webwork stores for your homework set. In the homework set, webwork keeps track of "problem 1 is this PG file, and Problem 2 is this PG file" and so on. For example, in the screenshot above, there is a homework set called <u>Homework04</u> and the 5th problem is looking for a file called <u>Library/CollegeOfIdaho/setAlgebra_01_04_SolveLinearEq/14IntAlg_09_SolveLinear.pg</u> but this is not found.)
</p>
<p>In this case, in the File Manager area, there is no folder called <u>Library</u>, and no subfolder called <u>CollegeOfIdaho</u>. The detials of your situation may be a little different, but the <u>This problem file was empty!</u> error is about not being able to find the PG file in the expected location. You can look for the NEW location of this problem, and fix it in the homework sets editor, or find a REPLACEMENT problem. But for one other option, you may just need a "link" to <u>Library</u> to be made as a shortcut to the Open Problem Library. The administrator can create this link for you, and that may solve all of the problems where the missing file was in a top-level folder called <u>Library</u>. </p>


<h2>While most problems in the Library Browser are showing, some statistics problems are not</h2>
It is probably related to the R server. To confirm this, from the Library Browser, click the "eye" icon to preview the problem (or, you might already be in a single problem in a homework set). If the error you see looks like this:
{% highlight plaintext %}

with the key thing being the second line saying <u>RserveClient.pl</u> and the third line saying <u>Rserve.pm</u> then ask the administrator to start/restart the Rserve server.
 
<h2>I can access my course, but it's not showing up in course list</h2>
I am able to log in, but my course is not shown on the <a href="https://webworkcanvas.uwlax.edu/webwork2/">course list</a>.
<ul>
<li>Everything will actually run just fine, and students are not looking at the left navigation bar or the course list page anyway,
since they will access direct links from your Canvas. Nevertheless, if you want it to show, ask the administrator to "unhide" your course.</li>
<li>Courses can be hidden or shown. (It is typical to hide a course when it hasn't been used for a while, so that the list of courses is not cluttered.
Hiding a course keeps all the content there. In fact, it is still possible for you and for your students to log in.)</li>
</ul>
