<h1>Intro to LaTeX</h1>

<ul>
<li>If you do not want to have the lag of an internet connection, then on Windows I suggest you download the <a href="http://miktex.org/download">Basic MiKTeX installer</a>. During the installation process, choose to install needed packages automatically. As part of the installation, the TeXWorks latex editor is installed. Open TeXWorks, as this is the app where you type, and compile to see a PDF preview.</li>
</ul>
