<h1>Options for getting started with LaTeX on Windows</h1>

<ul>

  <li>If you do not want to have the lag of an internet connection, then on Windows I suggest you download the <a href="http://miktex.org/download">Basic MiKTeX installer</a>. During the installation process, choose to install needed packages automatically. As part of the installation, the TeXWorks latex editor is installed. Open TeXWorks, as this is the app where you type, and compile to see a PDF preview.</li>

  <li>If you do not wish to install anything on your computer, create a free account at <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">overleaf.com</a>. 
  Here, you will type LaTeX into the middle column, and a preview of what the PDF would look like shows in the right column after clicking <u>Recompile</u>. 
  The pro about using Overleaf is that it is fully online (so you do not have to download then install anything on a computer), 
  but the downside is that you are waiting for your work over an internet connection, and the delay might be annoying.
