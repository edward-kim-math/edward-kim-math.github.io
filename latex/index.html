<h1>Intro to LaTeX</h1>

<p>LaTeX is a system for typing mathematics. It is especially helpful when you need to write in sentences, and include math in the <i>flow</i> of what you are saying, which is very often the case when needing to make a logical argument in the form of a proof.</p>

These are the primary ways to get your computer ready for LaTeX:
<ul>
<li>Create a free account at <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">overleaf.com</a>. Here, you will type LaTeX into the middle column, and a preview of what the PDF would look like shows in the right column after clicking <u>Recompile</u>. If you need to download the original source, it will be embedded in a ZIP: in the upper left is the Menu button. Click on this, then click on SOURCE to download. The pro about using Overleaf is that it is fully online (so you do not have to download then install anything on a computer), but the downside is that you are waiting for your work over an internet connection, and the delay might be annoying.</li>
<li>If you do not want to have the lag of an internet connection, then on Windows I suggest you download the <a href="http://miktex.org/download">Basic MiKTeX installer</a>. During the installation process, choose to install needed packages automatically. As part of the installation, the TeXWorks latex editor is installed. Open TeXWorks, as this is the app where you type, and compile to see a PDF preview.</li>
<li>If you do not want to have the lag of an internet connection, then on Mac I suggest you download <a href="https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html">MacTeX</a>. As part of the installation, the TeXShop latex editor is installed. Open TeXShop, as this is the app where you type, and compile to see a PDF preview.</li>
</ul>
Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFOtLnL_Krw">video I made</a> that walks through the whole thing with overleaf. Even if you don't use overleaf (and you choose to go with MikTeX or MacTeX), the video will be helpful to watch.
