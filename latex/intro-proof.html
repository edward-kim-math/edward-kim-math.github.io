<h2>Logical operations</h2>
{% highlight latex %}
Negation: $\neg p$
Conjunction: $p \wedge q$
Disjunction: $p \vee q$
Implication: $p \rightarrow q$
Biconditional: $p \leftrightarrow q$
{% endhighlight %}


<h2>Truth table</h2>
{% highlight latex %}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c||c}
$p$ & $q$ & $p \wedge q$ \\ \hline
$T$ & $T$ & $T$ \\
$T$ & $F$ & $F$ \\
$F$ & $T$ & $F$ \\
$F$ & $F$ & $F$
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
{% endhighlight %}
The version above has $ surrounding each T or F value, but this may be too tedious. Feel free to instead leave out the $s for Ts and Fs as in the following example:
{% highlight latex linenos %}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c||c}
$p$ & $q$ & $p \rightarrow q$ \\ \hline
T & T & T \\
T & F & F \\
F & T & T \\
F & F & T
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
{% endhighlight %}
In the { } after \begin{tabular}, you see c for centered text, followed by | for drawing a vertical line, a c for centered text, || for double vertical line (use just one vertical line if you don't like the look of the double vertical line), followed again by c for centering. The double-backslash gets a new row of the table, while \hline creates a horizontal line.

<h2>How do I get alignment of mathematical notation?</h2>
Use the & symbol to get alignment to happen. Below is a sample bit of code:
{% highlight latex %}
\begin{align*}
a &= b \\
&= c \\
&\leq d
\end{align*}
{% endhighlight %}
You can copy-paste the above into your code to see that the first line will be a=b, the next line has =c and the last line will be "less than or equal to d". Because the & is right in front of equal signs and the \leq, it is these three symbols (one per line) which will be aligned vertically.
